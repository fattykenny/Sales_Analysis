## Data Modelling and Transformation

The dataset used is an excel file cleaned and transformed in Power Query of Power BI.
 I was able to do the following.
 * Prepare Data Model Files in Power Query
 * Extracting the Fact and Dimension Tables
 * Investigating and resolving issues with table relationships
 * I used slicers to make filters for better interaction and Buttons to navigate between Sales dashboard and Profit dashboard
